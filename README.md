## MapleLeaflet
MapleLeaflet is a gem for building maps with the leaflet.js mapping library.  Leaflet.js is an awesome open source library developed by Vladimir Agafonkin.  You can learn more about it at www.leafletjs.com.
 
With MapleLeaflet you can create the following layers provided by the leaflet.js API:

        - markers
        - circles
        - polygons
        - popups
        - GeoJSON

### Examples

### Notes
For now MapleLeaflet only uses tilesets from OpenStreetMap though I plan to expand that soon.  MapleLeaflet also assumes that the leaflet directory is in the same directory as the exported html file. Please see the examples directory for tips on how to use maple_leafet.

### Coming Soon
       - support for other tilesets
       - less stringent inputs for choropleth map building
       - ability to modify map state
